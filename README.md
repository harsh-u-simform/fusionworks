    cd fusionworks
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

## Configuration

1. **Database Configuration:**

   Edit the `settings.py` file in the `fusionworks` directory to configure your database settings. For example:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'fusionworks_db',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',

        }
    }
    ```

2. **Secret Key:**

   Ensure that your `SECRET_KEY` is set in the `settings.py` file. For production, use environment variables to manage the secret key.

3. **Static and Media Files:**

   Configure the paths for static and media files in the `settings.py` file as needed.
